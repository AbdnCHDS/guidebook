# Getting started

## Naming files and folders {#names}

There are three main principles for good file names. They should be:

**1. Human readable**

+ Choose names that are related to the content of the file. Is it a file of demographic data? Don't call it "Dimitra's data.csv". Call it "demographics.csv".
+ Use hyphens "-" to separate words so the file names are easier to read. For example, if you have a file with code that loads and cleans your demographic data, you could call it "load-clean-demographics.r". It's easier than "loadcleandemographics.r". And it's definitely more relevant than "Dimitra's data analysis.r" 

**2. Machine readable**

+ Avoid spaces, punctuation, and any unusual characters.
+ Use underscores "_" as delimiters to separate units of metadata. For example, if you have data from different groups, dates and clinics in separate files, you have three units of metadata (group, date and clinic), and a good file name would be: "2020-08-04_group01_clinic04.csv"  

**3. Sortable**

+ If you have a date in your file name, put the date first, and make sure it's in the YYYY-MM-DD standard, so your files are ordered chronologically.
+ If you have numbers, pad with zeros (01,02,...,09,10,11,... instead of 1,2,...,9,10,11,...) to make sure they are ordered correctly.


## Project organisation {#folders}
The folder structure is designed from the ACHDS researcher perspective with Grampian Data Safe Haven (DaSH) elements incorporated as appropriate.  The folder names and overall structure would be the same across ACHDS and DaSH. 

Further details of the contents of each folder can be found in the table at the bottom of this document. 

The terms used in this paper are also recorded in the draft [ACHDS / DaSH dictionary](https://365abdn.sharepoint.com/teams/coviData/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B7D86F582-2DC2-4829-9D54-36C6F57269CA%7D&file=DaSH%20Dictionary.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&CT=1623049838629&OR=ItemsView) which can be found in the Data Lab Shared Drive on Teams and Sharepoint. 

Each new project in DaSH will be accompanied by this document, so that the researcher can clearly see and follow the structure.  It will also be published in the ACHDS Guidebook for researchers and students. DaSH plans to write a process incorporating this document for DaSH staff.
