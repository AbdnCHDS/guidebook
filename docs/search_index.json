[["index.html", "ACHDS Guidebook Overview Aim Sections This book", " ACHDS Guidebook Overview This guidebook describes the data and coding standards and processes we follow at the Aberdeen Centre for Health Data Science, that enable us to collaborate and create reproducible research. It is being developed by existing team members, to help new members get started. Aim There are many exciting things to consider when starting a new health data science project. For example: What is the purpose of the project? What data do you need to answer your questions? What is the best type of visualisation that will allow you to convey your message? What is the most suitable statistical analysis? The analysis, the visualisation - these are the fun and interesting aspects of the project, that you want to spend all your time doing. So you quickly create a folder called project, put your data in a file called data, and your analysis code in a file called analysis. After a bit of work you save this as analysis_2, because youve updated it but dont want to lose the original. When you receive an updated version of the input data, you realise that your analysis code no longer works, so you copy and paste the parts that do work into a new file what you call new_analysis By the end of the project you have a folder full of files with variations of similar, generic names that (hopefully) make perfect sense to you at that point in time. But it is completely unhelpful for everyone else, including yourself a few months into the future. If you had just spent a bit more time organising your project in the beginning, choosing sensible names, keeping good track of your changes, documenting and testing your code, you would have ended up with a project that was not only useful to you just when you finished it, but for many years later, to you and other researchers. But deciding how to organise a project, how to write tests and documentation is not only rather boring, but its also not something researchers are taught how to do.Thats why we are all tempted to skip it! So the point of this guidebook is to explain what you need to do and how to do it, to ensure your project can be used and reproduced by others. We hope you find it useful! Sections Our guidebook is work in progress, and everyone is invited to contribute. If youd like to help improve our guidebook, have a look here: https://github.com/AbdnCHDS/guidebook The sections we have thought about including so far are: How to structure your project folders (to keep data, methods and outputs separate) How to name your files (so they are human &amp; machine readable, and can be ordered well) How to document your data (what information to include about the dataset creators, description, license, variables, etc.) Basic data quality control (what to use for missing values in datasets, standard checks on range of values, value types, number of expected observations, etc.) Good coding practices (documentation, testing, version control) Troubleshooting code and asking for help (i.e. how to create minimal working examples) Good code reviewing practices Resources for learning R Collaboration (using Github for hosting projects, and enabling peer review and tracking team contributions) We are focusing on R, as it is a very commonly used programming language in data science. If you use a different language such as Python, it would be great to add some non-R resources! This book This book is built with Bookdown, based on the psyTeachR book template by Lisa DeBruine.

They should be: 1. Human readable Choose names that are related to the content of the file. Is it a file of demographic data? Dont call it Dimitras data.csv. Call it demographics.csv. Use hyphens - to separate words so the file names are easier to read. For example, if you have a file with code that loads and cleans your demographic data, you could call it load-clean-demographics.r. Its easier than loadcleandemographics.r. And its definitely more relevant than Dimitras data analysis.r 2. Machine readable Avoid spaces, punctuation, and any unusual characters. Use underscores \"_\" as delimiters to separate units of metadata. For example, if you have data from different groups, dates and clinics in separate files, you have three units of metadata (group, date and clinic), and a good file name would be: 2020-08-04_group01_clinic04.csv 3. Sortable If you have a date in your file name, put the date first, and make sure its in the YYYY-MM-DD standard, so your files are ordered chronologically. If you have numbers, pad with zeros (01,02,,09,10,11, instead of 1,2,,9,10,11,) to make sure they are ordered correctly. 2.2 Project organisation There are many ways to organise your project, but the main recommendation is to keep input data, methods and outputs separate. So the main folder structure should reflect this. 1. Inputs The Inputs folder contains: Input data A metadata file, which is a file that describes the data, for example who created it, when, usage rights, etc. See chapter on data documentation. A definitions file, which explains what each variable in the dataset is It might not be possible to include your actual input data in your project folder. This could be because: It is too large, and it is stored somewhere else online, so there is no reason to copy it locally. In that case, you need to include a clear explanation of where the data is stored, and what you need to do to access it (for example, you may need to create an account). It would be great to include a small subset of the data, to demonstrate what it looks like, and to allow you to develop and test your analysis code on it without having to access the remote data. It is private and cannot be publicly shared (you have permissions to access it in a secure environment such as the Grampian Data Safe Haven). In that case, create a dummy dataset that contains the same variables as the real dataset, but fake data. The purpose of this is again to demonstrate what the real data looks like, and allow you to develop and test your analysis code. 2. Methods The Methods folder contains: Analysis code, including code to input and test the quality of your input data. See chapter on data quality. Documentation of code. It is possible to combine code and documentation in a single document, using tools such as R Markdown. See chapter on code documentation. Code tests, to make sure your code does what you want it to do. See chapter on code testing. 3. Outputs Outputs may be different for each project, depending on the project aims. They could be: A manuscript for publication, including figures, bibliography, etc. A new dataset, which needs to be accompanied by a metadata file and a definitions file, and short examples of code for accessing and using the new dataset A new computer model or analysis method, which should include documentation and examples of use You can create your folder structure on your local computer, but you need a good backup system, and you also need to keep your code under version control (which means keeping track of changes you make). So we recommend you create your project as a Github repository. See chapter on version control.

This information is essential to ensure your research remains repeatable, transparent, discoverable and citable. It may seem like an onerous task but the steps given below should bring you quickly towards having documentation on your project available in formats which can be read by humans and machines. If you do not have a background in coding or data management do not fear! Help with this task is just an email away. Contact either Bernhard Scheliga or Claire Bell. 3.1 What is Metadata? Metadata is [] the information we create, store, and share to describe things, allows us to interact with these things to obtain the knowledge we need. Riley 2017 One problem is, the term metadata [] is used in so many different contexts and applied to so many different things that it sometimes seems to convey very little meaning. Day 2005 This guide tries to avoid the more generic use of the term metadata as it can lead to confusion. So when the term metadata is used, it refers simply to the schema used to encode the information, for example Dublin Core. The term documentation will be used to refer to detail both about the project (its aims, coverage and methodology) as well as object level information (such as the file format of the resulting output of the project). To ease communication within ACDHS the following two terms are used to discuss the overarching information given about a research project: 3.2 ACHDS Metadata Template To encourage creation of high quality project and object level metadata, ACHDS has created a template for you to use throughout your project from inception to conclusion. Although you might not be able to fill out the entire template at the beginning of the template, it is important that you start this work at the planning stage of your project. It will help alert you to some of the decisions needing made, such as the creation of variable names to be used in data collection and, importantly, help keep track of these decisions. In the long run, starting early can save alot of time and administrative burden. The universitys Data Librarian and the team of Data Stewards are available to help you as you work through this. Once complete the librarian will take the free text entries and add controlled vocabularies and coding to the document and generate both a human readable Readme file and a machine readable file. These two documents should accompany your data set in the repository of your choice and provide a helpful information to other researchers learning from your project or considering re-using your data. To obtain a copy of the template form please contact either Claire Bell or Bernhard Scheliga. 3.3 Use Controlled Vocabulary TO DO: Add examples for controlled Vocabulary If you are analysing secondary data, it is likely the variable names for your dataset will already have been created and defined. However, if you are creating a new dataset, it is recommended that you use a Controlled Vocabulary when choosing the names for your data variables. This will mean that your dataset can be joined with other datasets using the same vocabulary with greater ease and much less work. So what is a controlled vocabulary? Broadly speaking, Controlled Vocabularies can range from a short list of clearly defined, mutually exclusive, and exhaustive terms, which are the only choices for usage in a specific context (e.g., populating certain DDI elements or attributes) through a classification to something as complex as a thesaurus with thousands of terms and term relationships. https://ddialliance.org/taxonomy/term/167 Once you have chosen a vocabulary to use to name your variables, please ensure that the choice is documented in the Dataset section of the ACHDS template. Much of the information you provide at project level also benefits through use of controlled vocabulary. The Data Librarian is happy to help you by converting the free text you have provided into vocabulary from controlled standards. For example, for subject keywords, you can use a controlled vocabularl as well as free text. It is recommended that terms provided by the Library of Congress Authorised Subject Headings and MESH medical subject headings are used. The language of a document can also be encoded using a standard. This aides discoverability on online searches. ISO 639-2 schema provides a list of internationally recognised codes for languages that can easily be understood by a computer. 3.4 Creating a persistent identifier for your dataset and project The creation of a persistent identifier (PID) for your dataset ensures that others can both cite and access your dataset. This is important as it helps you to show your contribution to research and increases the findability and accessibility of your data. A commonly used PID is the Digital Object Identifier (DOI). There are different ways to obtain a PID: 1. Many repositories automatically create a DOI for you when you deposit your dataset making this one less step to think about. 2. If your chosen repository does not create a DOI or other form of PID for you, you can enter your dataset into the universitys repository using Pure. This will create a DOI for you without needing you to deposit your information in the respository. For help entering a dataset into Pure, please contact the Copyright Librarian Mary Mowat. 3.5 References The preceding guidelines have been adapted from several sources, including: Riley J,Understanding Metadata: What is Metadata, and What is it For?, National Information Standards Organization Day M, (November 2005), Metadata, DCC Digital Curation Manual, S.Ross, M.Day (eds),Retrieved Cessda Documentation and metadata Cornell University Guide to writing readme style metadata How to FAIR: metadata RDA COVID-19 Recommendations and Guidelines on Data Sharing Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium UK Data Service: Catalogue Metadata "],["dataquality.html", "Chapter 4 Data quality", " Chapter 4 Data quality What to use for missing variables?

Metadata is such an all encompassing term. Data about data could be just about anything. So within ACHDS we need a short hand way to know what people are referring to when they use the term metadata. A common approach to this is to divide the term into categories. (HowToFair - Denmark)[https://howtofair.dk/how-to-fair/metadata/] We distinguish between three main types of metadata: Administrative metadata are data about a project or resource that are relevant for managing it; for example, project/ resource owner, principal investigator, project collaborators, funder, project period, etc. They are usually assigned to the data, before you collect or create them. Descriptive or citation metadata are data about a dataset or resource that allow people to discover and identify it; for example, authors, title, abstract, keywords, persistent identifier, related publications, etc. Structural metadata are data about how a dataset or resource came about, but also how it is internally structured. Structural metadata describe, for example, the unit of analysis, collection method, sampling procedure, sample size, categories, variables, etc. Structural metadata have to be gathered by the researchers according to best practice in their research community and will be published together with the data. Descriptive and structural metadata should be added continuously throughout the project. (Cessda)[https://www.cessda.eu/Training/Training-Resources/Library/Data-Management-Expert-Guide/2.-Organise-Document/Documentation-and-metadata] The project-level documentation explains the aims of the study, what the research questions/hypotheses are, what methodologies were being used, what instruments and measures were being used, etc. Data-level or object-level documentation provides information at the level of individual objects such as pictures or interview transcripts or variables in a database. You can embed data-level information in data files. For example, in interviews, it is best to write down the contextual and descriptive information about each interview at the beginning of each file. And for quantitative data variable and value names can be embedded within the data file itself. (RDA IG Metadata)[https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/metadata-ig.html] metadata modalities of description, restriction, navigation, provenance, preservation and the use of metadata for the purposes discovery, contextualisation, validation, analytical processing, simulation, visualisation and interoperation.

Data Type: DDI Alliance Controlled Vocabulary for Data Type @ Cessda String Finite sequences of characters. NormalizedStringType of string in which any occurrence of whitespace (including tabs, line feeds, and carriage returns) is replaced by a single space. Boolean True or false. Can be represented by 1 and 0 correspondingly. Decimal A subset of real numbers, which can be represented by a finite-length sequence of decimal digits (0-9) separated by a period as a decimal indicator. An optional leading sign is allowed. If the sign is omitted, + is assumed. Leading and trailing zeroes are optional. If the fractional part is zero, the period and following zero(es) can be omitted. For example: -1.23, 12678967.543233, +100000.00, 210. Integer Whole numbers, the infinite set of integers, no minimum or maximum value. DateTime Integer-valued year, month, day, hour and minute, plus decimal-valued second property, and time zone hour and minute (e.g., 2002-10-10T12:00:00-05:00). Time Left-truncated dateTime, e.g., 13:20:00-05:00 (1:20 pm for Eastern Standard Time U.S.). Date Integer-valued year, month, day, and time zone hour and minutes, e.g., 2003-06-30-05:00 (30 June 2003 Eastern Standard Time U.S.). Removed from draft of guidebook NOTE: follow the dumb-down- &amp; one-to-one- princinple dumb-down-princinple: leave out what is not needed one-to-one- princinple: A.6 Human readable metadata - A Readme file Create a simple Readme document to accompany your dataset in the repository. Use a plain text file wherever possible and avoid using proprietary formats. This will aid sharing. Name the Readme file so that it is easily associated with the data file(s) it describes. Keep the layout of the document clear so that it is easy to understand, (e.g avoid lengthy paragraphs). The content section below outlines the type of information to include. A.7 Metadata for machines You will also need to create another information file but this time for machines rather than humans. There are a range of metadata standards available to enable you to do this. Dublin Core is an example. It is a domain agnostic, basic and widely used metadata standard. Fortunately there is choice of tools available to help you create the appropriate metadata in a machine readable format. This will save you having to learn new metadata standards and controlled vocabularies. *Dublin Core Metadata Generator "]]
