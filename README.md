# Aberdeen Centre for Health Data Science Guidebook

Hello and welcome to the ACHDS guidebook project! :tada:

Our goal is to develop data and coding standards that we encourage ACHDS team members to follow, to enable us to collaborate and create reproducible research. This is published here: https://abdnchds.github.io/guidebook/

We would like all current members of the team to contribute. Please read through the contributing guidelines below, and get in touch with [Dimitra](https://github.com/dblana) if you have any questions :smiley:

## Contributor Guidelines

**1. Participate in Teams discussion**

Most of our discussions take place in an MS Team and our weekly lab meetings (Thursdays at 14:05). We aim to discuss one topic every week, and create guidelines based on our discussion. So please join the meetings or add your thoughts to the Team channel or Wiki.

**2. Set up Github account**

Please set up a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and sign in. Here are some [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account). Let us know you've done this so we can add you to the ACHDS organisation.

**3. Decide on how you'd like to contribute**

There are a few ways to contribute:

* Correct typing mistakes or make other small improvements to the text
* Add more details to an existing chapter
* Create a new chapter

You might also just like to suggest improvements to the guidebook, but not make the changes yourself. This is also very welcome! In this case, you just need to do step 4 below: add an issue describing your suggested improvement.

**4. Add an issue describing your suggested contribution**

Once you've identified a way to contribute, please let us know what you're planning to do by adding a new issue [here](https://github.com/AbdnCHDS/guidebook/issues). Issues are basically tasks that we want to achieve, so by adding your issue to the list we can keep track of who is working on what.

Please don't skip this step, as knowing what you're planning on doing in advance ensures you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out. Here is [more information about Github issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-your-work-with-issues).

**5. Fork this repository**

*Note: You only need to do this once, before your first contribution.*

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the ACHDS guidebook repository to your profile. "Forking" means making a copy of the repository, so you can make any changes you like without affecting the guidebook (yet - you will submit these changes to the guidebook in step 7 :smiley:).  

**6. Go ahead and make your changes to your forked repository**

Based on the type of change you are making, there may be additional steps. This is another benefit of step 4: once we know what you'd like to do, we can guide you through the process of making the change.

**7. Submit a pull request**

A [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests) is the method by which you let us know of the contribution you have made and would like to add to the guidebook.

A member of the main team will review your changes, have a bit of discussion and hopefully "merge" them in (add them to our guidebook).

**Success!!** :balloon::balloon::balloon: Well done! And thank you :smiley:
