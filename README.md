# Aberdeen Centre for Health Data Science Guidebook

Hello and welcome to the ACHDS guidebook project! :tada:

Our goal is to develop data and coding standards that we encourage ACHDS team members to follow, to enable us to collaborate and create reproducible research. This is published here: https://abdnchds.github.io/guidebook/

We would like all current members of the team to contribute. Please read through the contributing guidelines below, and get in touch with [Dimitra](https://github.com/dblana) if you have any questions :smiley:

## Contributor Guidelines

**1. Participate in Teams discussion**

Most of our discussions take place in an MS Team and our weekly lab meetings (Thursdays at 14:05). We aim to discuss one topic every week, and create guidelines based on our discussion. So please join the meetings or add your thoughts to the Team channel or Wiki.

**2. Set up Github account**

Please set up a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and sign in. Here are some [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account). Let us know you've done this so we can add you to the ACHDS organisation.

**3. Decide on how you'd like to contribute**

There are a few ways to contribute:

* Create a new chapter 
  * For this, you need to create a new .md file. Its name needs to start with the chapter number, which should be one higher than the number of existing chapters. For example, if there are eight existing chapters, the new chapter should be named 09-Chapter-Topic.md. 
  * If you want to add a chapter in the middle of the guidebook, you'll need to rename all the following chapters. (Make sure you have the team's agreement before you do this!) The name of the chapter as it appears in the guidebook is not taken from the file name, but from the level 1 header in the file. 
  * Make sure there is a single level 1 header in your file, otherwise it will be divided into multiple chapters.
* Add more details to an existing chapter 
  * If it's a small addition, you can edit the existing chapter file, let's say 09-Chapter-Topic.md. 
  * If you will be adding a lot of content, it might be better to add a second file, which should then be named 09.1-Sub-Chapter-Topic.md. 
  * Make sure there are no level 1 headers in the sub-chapter file, otherwise it will be rendered as a new chapter.    
* Correct typing mistakes or make other small improvements to the text. You can do this by editing the existing chapter .md files.

You might also just like to suggest improvements to the guidebook, but not make the changes yourself. This is also very welcome! In this case, you just need to do step 4 below: add an issue describing your suggested improvement.

**4. Add an issue describing your suggested contribution (or assign an existing issue to yourself)**

Once you've identified a way to contribute, please let us know what you're planning to do by adding a new issue [here](https://github.com/AbdnCHDS/guidebook/issues), or assign an existing issue to yourself. Issues are basically tasks that we want to achieve, so by adding your issue to the list we can keep track of who is working on what.

Please don't skip this step, as knowing what you're planning on doing in advance ensures you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out. Here is [more information about Github issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/managing-your-work-with-issues).

**5. Create a new branch (and give it a name associated with the issue)**

Using a separate [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches) allows you to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository.

**6. Create a draft pull request and add "closes #[issue number]" in the description**

A [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests) is the method by which you let us know of the contribution you have made. Adding "closes #[issue number]" in the description [links the pull request to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword). This shows that work is in progress to address the issue, and it automatically closes the issue when the pull request is merged.

**7. Go ahead and make your changes to your branch**

Make sure you commit your changes frequently, and use good commit messages that briefly describe the changes you made.

**8. Change the draft pull request to "ready for review"**

When you are ready to get feedback from other team members, [change the draft pull request to ready to review](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request#marking-a-pull-request-as-ready-for-review). You can ask specific team members to [review your changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews). 

**9. Merge the pull request**

When you get approval from the reviewer, merge the pull request and delete the branch (this closes the issue).
**Success!!** :balloon::balloon::balloon: Well done! And thank you :smiley:
