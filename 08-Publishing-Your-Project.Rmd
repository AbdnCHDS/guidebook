# Publishing your project


##Publishing your code alongside your data
##Publishing single research objects in project, e.g. datasets, interviews
##Lab Notebooks?

##Choosing where to publish your data
There are various things to consider when choosing where to archive and or publish your data:
* How long do you need to keep your data?  The length of time may be mandated by the funder.
* Would it be best to store it in a disipline or domain centred archive?
* Do you need to consider issues related to senstive data or GDPR?
* What size is your data?
* Do you have a preservation budget?

A good repository should:
* Provide a persistent identifier (PID) for your dataset. This helps to make it easily findable by others.
* Enable you to easily provide contextual information about your dataset to enable it to be re-useable.
* Takes the information you provide an publishes it in both human readable and machine readable formats, so that the information is both findable and accessible.
* Encourages re-use of your data though the implementation of Knowledge Organisation Systems, such as recognised standard vocabularies.
* Provides long term access to your data.  (A repository which has gained the Core Trust Seal guarentees access to the data should the repository go bankrupt.)

Sound like an awful lot to bear in mind?  Re3data have created a tool to help you choose the most appropriate repository for your work. https://www.re3data.org


##But my data needs to remain private...
You can still tell the world about your research and keep your data private.  Using a repository like Dataverse means that you can publish your metadata, that is the contextual information about your dataset, to enable the information about your project to be easily found, and then keep the data privately and securely elsewhere.

##Licences 
[Adding License manually to Github repopsitory](https://github.com/santisoler/cc-licenses) 

##Orcid ID
(2021-03-29)  Add note about using orcid ID when publishing data in case you move institution so you remain contactable.  Also much research is cross-disciplinary so you might need to use multiple repositories 
 

## Creating a persistent identifier for your dataset and project
The creation of a persistent identifier (PID) for your dataset ensures that others can both cite and access your dataset. This is important as it helps you to show your contribution to research and increases the findability and accessibility of your data.  

A commonly used PID is the Digital Object Identifier (DOI). There are different ways to obtain a PID:
1. Many repositories automatically create a DOI for you when you deposit your dataset making this one less step to think about.
2. If your chosen repository does not create a DOI or other form of PID for you, you can enter your dataset into the university's repository using Pure. This will create a DOI for you without needing you to deposit your information in the respository.   For help entering a dataset into Pure, please contact the Copyright Librarian [Mary Mowat](mary.mowat@abdn.ac.uk).

##Show how you wish your data set to be cited
