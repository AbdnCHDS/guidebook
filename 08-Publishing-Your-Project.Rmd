# Publishing your project
(This chapter goes hand in hand with the chapters on data storage and data documentation.)

The publication of your data is often mandated by funders.  Done well, publication can increase the potential of the dataset you have worked hard to collect. This section will look at ways of making an informed decision about where best to publish your data, and how to do this so that others can access, understand, use and cite it.  

Data publishing is not something you leave until the end of the project.  You need to **plan for publication right from the start**. 

This chapter will look at what to publish and the various pathways to publication, all guided by the FAIR principles.

## Choosing whether to publish

First and foremost, do you have consent to publish your data?  Does it contain sensitive data?  If you do not have consent, or if there are legal restrictions, or the data is sensitive, do not publish without seeking advice first.  The university's Digital Research Specialists and the Scholarly Communications Team based at the Library can provide help with this.

Secondly, is your dataset re-useable?  That is, is it in a state and format that can be read and used?  If it is not there is little point in putting in the effort required to publish it.  Published datasets which cannot be used, can potentially attract negative feedback to your work.

## Choosing how to publish your data

It is recommended that you publish your data set alongside contextual information which explains it.  If you publish the data in isolation, it can easily become lost, hard to access or impossible to repeat.  To help mitigate against these problems it is a wise idea to publish your dataset as a package that includes:
1. The dataset(s)
2. Contextual information about the dataset, often referred to as metadata.  Please see [chapter 3](https://abdnchds.github.io/guidebook/metadata.html) for guidance.
3. Any accompanying code so that others can easily see what you did to the raw data.
4. Your lab notebooks.

## Choosing where to publish your data

You can choose to publish your data as supplementary material to a journal article or by placing it in a repository.  

There are various things to consider when choosing where to archive and/or publish your data:
* How easy will it be to publish your accompanying information package along with your dataset?
* How long do you need to keep your data?  The length of time may be mandated by the funder.
* Do you need to consider issues related to senstive data or GDPR?
* What size is your data?
* Do you have a preservation budget?

### Publishing the data as supplementary data alongside a journal article.
Currently, publishing your data alongside the journal article, is the most popular pathway, though this looks to be changing as researchers become more informed about the choices they have, and the advantages and disadvantages of each.

Using a journal for dataset publication can be helpful to other researchers as the data is readily available alongside published findings.  However, publishers do not always insist that the published dataset is re-useable andpublication via a journal is costly. The journal may also claim copyright over the data or keep it behind a subscription wall. This does not comply with FAIR principles

### Choosing a respository.
There are a range of repositories to choose from, each with their own benefits.  Make sure the repository you choose, meets your requirements, for example, is the long-term preservation of your data guaranteed?  Use of a respository can meet two tasks at the same time - the need to archive your data securely and appropriatey with the option to publish your data.

Re3data have created a tool to help you choose the most appropriate repository for your work. :toolbox: [Re3data](https://www.re3data.org) :toolbox:

There are different types of repositories such as:
* **Subject-specific data repository** - this means that your data will be stored alongside similar datasets, making searches for useful information potentially more fruitful.  Choose one that is well known and trusted in your community.  Such repositories usually encourage the deposit of high quality data with strong accompanying contextual information to enable re-use.
* **General data repository**. - Repositories like Zenodo, Figshare or the Harvard Dataverse provide accessible ways of archiving and publishing your data.
* **Institutional repository** - This provides researchers looking at working for a unviersity a good overview of the work of the university.

A good repository should:
* Provide a persistent identifier (PID) for your dataset. This helps to make it easily findable by others.
* Enable you to easily provide adequate contextual information about your dataset to enable it to be re-useable.
* Takes the information you provide and publishes it in both human readable and machine readable formats, so that the information is both findable and accessible.
* Encourages re-use of your data though the implementation of Knowledge Organisation Systems, such as recognised standard vocabularies.
* Provides long term access to your data.  (A repository which has gained the Core Trust Seal guarentees access to the data should the repository go bankrupt.)

A repository might also offer different levels of access permissions:
* Completely open access
* Access for registered users only.
* Restricted access, granted only on request.
* Availability of temporary embargos, so that the data only becomes open access after a certain period of time.

## But my data needs to remain completely private...
You can still tell the world about your research and keep your data private.  Using a repository like Dataverse means that you can publish your metadata, that is the contextual information about your dataset, to enable the information about your project to be easily found, and then store the data privately and securely elsewhere.

## Creating a persistent identifier for your dataset and project
A persistent identifier is a long-lasting reference to a document, file, webpage, person, etc. A DOI (digital object identifier) is a type of persistent identifier used to identfiy and locate digital objects such as research reports, datasets and commercial videos.  

Ideally you should choose a repository which automatically creates a DOI on deposit of your dataset, or, if the dataset is to be kept privately, create a DOI simply for the contextual informtion about your dataset.  The DOI helps others to find, access and cite your dataset (where appropriate). 

If your chosen repository does not create a DOI or other form of PID for you, you can enter your dataset into the university's repository using Pure. This will create a DOI for you without needing you to deposit your information in the respository.   For help entering information about a dataset into Pure, please contact the library Pure administrators at openaccess@abdn.ac.uk.

## Orcid ID
Remember when publishing your data set to include your Orcid ID in the accompanying information.  An Orcid ID is a persistent identifier that distinguishes you from anyone else with the same or a similar name.  You can connect your ID with your professional information, for example, affiliations, grants and publications. Using an Orcid ID also ensures that you remain contactable should you move institution, and joins your work across respositories, which is especially important if your research is cross-disciplinary.  For more information go to [https://orcid.org](https://orcid.org)

## Licences 
You are putting all your hard work out into a public space.  Make sure it is protected by a licence clearly letting others know what they can and cannot do with your work.  These sites should help you to choose the right licence for a variety of different materials:
* [Choose a Licence](https://choosealicense.com/)
* [Licence Selector](https://ufal.github.io/public-license-selector/)
* [Data World](https://help.data.world/hc/en-us/articles/115006114287-Common-license-types-for-datasets)

## Show how you wish your data set to be cited
To ensure that your work is properly cited, and credit is given where credit is due, please provide an example of how you wish your work to be cited using a standard format such as Harvard.
