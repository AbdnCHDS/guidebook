# Data documentation {#metadata}

this is messy, were messy and a pain to go through
## Problem with the definition of metadata

there are a number of standards, that we can follow 

Dublin Core https://dublincore.org/
Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) https://ddialliance.org/
Datacite Schema https://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.3/

## current Standard

Currently we are following the Dublic 

## Controlled Vocabulary 
Data Documentation Initiative (DDI)

Using controlled vocabularies 


Broadly speaking, a CV can range from a short list of clearly defined, mutually exclusive, and exhaustive terms, which are the only choices for usage in a specific context (e.g., populating certain DDI elements or attributes) through a classification to something as complex as a thesaurus with thousands of terms and term relationships. https://ddialliance.org/taxonomy/term/167

# Data documentation {#metadata}

Good research practice includes the provision of information about the data you have collected and the research processes you have undertaken.  This information is essential to ensure your research remains repeatable, transparent, discoverable and citable.  It may seem like an onerous task but the steps given below should bring you quickly towards having documentation on your project available in formats which can be read by humans and machines.  If you do not have a background in coding or data management do not fear!

##Human readable metadata - A Readme file
Create a simple Readme document to accompany your dataset in the repository.  Use a plain text file wherever possible and avoid using proprietary formats.  This will aid sharing.
Name the Readme file so that it is easily associated with the data file(s) it describes.
Keep the layout of the document clear so that it is easy to understand, (e.g avoid lengthy paragraphs). 
The content section below outlines the type of information to include.

##Metadata for machines
You will also need to create another information file but this time for machines rather than humans.  There are a range of metadata standards available to enable you to do this.  

Dublin Core is an example.  It is a domain agnostic, basic and widely used metadata standard.

Fortunately there is choice of tools available to help you create the appropriate metadata in a machine readable format.  This will save you having to learn new metadata standards and controlled vocabularies.

###Terminology
The vocabularly used in the metadata is often controlled by further standards.  

For example, for subject keywords, use a controlled vocabularly rather than using free text.  It is recommended that terms provided by the [Library of Congress Authorised Subject Headings](https://authorities.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First) and [MESH medical subject headings](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/search) are used.

In the machine readable document to provide information on the language of the data included in your dataset please use the ISO 639-2 schema which is managed by the Library of Congress and can be found here:  https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/langcodes-search.php  Simply put, this provides a list of internationally recognised codes for languages that can easily be understood by a computer.

##Content - A guideline to the information to include in both formats about your project

To maintain the quality of your dataset you will need to provide information about both the project and the data itself.
