# What to we need here?
- Definition on Metadata
- Action to be decided which to follow HowToFair (DK), CESSDA (EU-soc-science), 
- Two Documents 
    1) Metadata for dummies
    2) Metadata for professional dummies (Dublin Core, DataCite Schema)
 - Compare dublin core genenrator vs the DDI cookbook
 - DOI minting last section (Can PURE mint DOI for dataset not stored in PURE)


# Data documentation {#metadata}

this is messy, were messy and a pain to go through

##there are a number of standards, that we can follow 

Standards to make our resource findable on the website.
Standards to make our data more easily shared, such as use of controlled vocabulalies and research coding.

Dublin Core https://dublincore.org/
Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) https://ddialliance.org/
Datacite Schema https://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.3/

## current Standard

Currently we are following the Dublic 

# Data documentation {#metadata}

Good research practice includes the provision of information about the data you have collected and the research processes you have undertaken.  This information is essential to ensure your research remains repeatable, transparent, discoverable and citable.  It may seem like an onerous task but the steps given below should bring you quickly towards having documentation on your project available in formats which can be read by humans and machines.  If you do not have a background in coding or data management do not fear!

## What are we referring to when we use the term metadata?
In this context we are talking about information which provides detail about a project and its aims, coverage and methodology as well as object level information such as the file format of the resulting output of the project.  To ease communication within ACDHS the following two terms are used to discuss the overarching information given about a research project:
###  Project Level Metadata
This is the administrative information about a project.
###  Object Level Metadata
The information provided should enable another researcher accessing your dataset to generate fake data to use when developing code before applying it to your dataset.  

Often object level information can be provided at the beginning of the file. For example, in interviews, ithe contextual and descriptive information about each interview can be given at the beginning of each file.

For datasets a wider range of information is required, such as the provision of definitions for variable names, the method used to account for missing data and weighting applied.  The ACHDS passport should help you ensure you have this information readily to hand.

## ACHDS Project Passport
To encourage creation of high quality project and object level metadata, ACHDS has created a template for you to use throughout your project from inception to conclusion.  The university's Data Librarian is available to help you as you work through this.  Once complete the librarian will take the free text entries and add controlled vocabularies and coding to the document and generate both a human readable 'Readme' file and a machine readable file. These two documents should accompany your data set in the repository of your choice and provide a helpful information to other researchers learning from your project or considering re-using your data.

Working with the template from the beginning of a project can also help guide you through some of the decisions that need to be made, such as the creation of variable names to be used in data collection.

###What are Controlled Vocabularies?
The vocabularly used any metadata document is ususally controlled by further standards.  

"Broadly speaking, Controlled Vocabularies can range from a short list of clearly defined, mutually exclusive, and exhaustive terms, which are the only choices for usage in a specific context (e.g., populating certain DDI elements or attributes) through a classification to something as complex as a thesaurus with thousands of terms and term relationships." https://ddialliance.org/taxonomy/term/167

https://ddialliance.org/controlled-vocabularies

For example, for subject keywords, use a controlled vocabularly rather than using free text.  It is recommended that terms provided by the [Library of Congress Authorised Subject Headings](https://authorities.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First) and [MESH medical subject headings](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/search) are used.

In the machine readable document to provide information on the language of the data included in your dataset please use the ISO 639-2 schema which is managed by the Library of Congress and can be found here:  https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/langcodes-search.php  Simply put, this provides a list of internationally recognised codes for languages that can easily be understood by a computer.
