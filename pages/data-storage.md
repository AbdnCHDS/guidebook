# Data Storage and Back-up

Before you go any further with your project, you will need to decide where the data you collect, process and analyse will be stored and any implications this has for backup, on-going and long-term access, and security. Your data forms the backbone of your project. If the data becomes lost or is corrupted you may not be able to complete your project or verify it if required. ACHDS staff frequently work with highly sensitive data so it is essential that this data is stored appropriately and that no gateway is provided for unauthorized access.

You will also be prompted to think about storage and back-up when you work through your Data Management Plan. This will include questions such as these from the [DDC DMP Checklist](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP/DMP-checklist-flyer.pdf)

* Do you have sufficient storage or will you need to include charges for additional services?
* Who will be responsible for backup and recovery?
* What are the risks to data security and how will these be managed?
* How will you ensure that collaborators can access your data securely?

It is also important to consider how long you need to store your data for and who will be in charge of deleting it after this period has elapsed.

The university provides a range of storage solutions, and information about these can be found on the webpage [Data Storage and Archiving for Principal Investigators](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/staffnet/working-here/it-services/datastorage.php#panel2066), [Data Storage of Staff and PGR](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/it/service-portfolio/sc-pc-filestore.php). The data storage for your research project on the UoA shared drive can be requested [here](https://uoa.freshservice.com/support/catalog/items/157).

Note that in this instance 'archiving' does not refer to curation and storage of data, but simply to long term storage.  However, if you store clear [contextual information](data-documentation.md) and/or a completed [Data Documentation Template](https://github.com/AbdnCHDS/DataDocumentationTemplate) together with your data, then you will have done the necessary curatorial work to help your data be findable, understandable and re-useable.

Sometimes the publication process itself provides long term storage solutions.  Please see the [chapter on publication](publishing.md) for more information.
