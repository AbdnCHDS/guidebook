# Good Practice for Coding and Collaboration

We have put together a separate step-by-step guide that shows how to use git for version control, GitHub for collaboration, and how to write good code in R, including documentation. It is here: [Open Research How To](https://github.com/AbdnCHDS/open-research-how-to/tree/main)

## How to ask for help

We all need help at some point, and the easiest way for others to be able to help, is to provide them with a Minimal Reproducible Example. 

- Minimal: Try to isolate the part of your code that produces the problem, and only share that
- Reproducible: Make sure you include everything that is required to run the code and reproduce the problem. You will almost definitely need to include some data to run the code on, so you will need to create a minimal fake dataset.

Read more about Minimal Reproducible Examples on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). And of course there is an [R package for this](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/learn-reprex.html)!
