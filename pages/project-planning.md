# Things to consider when planning a project

* Do you require funding for your project? When writing a grant proposal, contact your business development officer for help.
* How much data storage and data archiving will you need for your project for how long?
* Does your funding body require you to write a Data management plan (pre or post award)?
* Should your project be in the Grampian Data Safe Haven (DaSH)?
