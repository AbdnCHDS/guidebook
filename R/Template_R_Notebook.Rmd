## Quick help

### What is this?

This is an R notebook template for the Aberdeen Centre of Health Data Science. It provides a simple and easy to use framework to promote more standardised reports and analysis/code documentation within the centre. The template is not intended as a rigid constructed, but more as entry point and foundation for a better more unified reporting practice. 
This is a ***first draft*** of the template. It was created by Bernhard Scheliga.

### How to use this?

* Please fill in the “title”, “author”, “date” above (line 2 – 4)
* Change line 5 to appropriate output file format, if needed
* Check out the R markdown sheet cheat [link] (https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)
* Comment your code!
* Please customize the template to fit your purpose. But please provide a brief summary of what you are trying to achieve with this R-script.


### R Notebook standard help text

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Please **DELETE** above


```{r echo=FALSE}
#Enter the Version of the data set here. If applicable or else delete this chunk.
Dataset_version <- "???"
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
#Delete chunk, if above does not apply
print(paste("Dataset version:", Dataset_version, sep = " "))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
print(paste("Date:", Sys.Date()))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
version$version.string
```
