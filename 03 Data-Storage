# Data Storage and Back-up

Before you go any further with your project, you will need to decide where the data you collect, process and analyse will be stored and any implications this has for backup, on-going and long-term access and security.

Who will be responsible for backup and recovery?
What are the risks to data security and how will these be managed?
How will you ensure that collaborators can access your data securely?
