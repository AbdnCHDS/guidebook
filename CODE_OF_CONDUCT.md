# Code of conduct

We want our ACHDS guidebook project to be an open and welcoming environment!

We are particularly keen to support first-time Github contributors and people who are looking to learn and develop their skills.

To create a positive environment for everyone, please:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the team
* Show empathy towards other team members
* Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.

To report an issue, please contact [Dimitra](https://github.com/dblana).
