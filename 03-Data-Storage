# Data Storage and Back-up

Before you go any further with your project, you will need to decide where the data you collect, process and analyse will be stored and any implications this has for backup, on-going and long-term access and security.  Your data forms the backbone of your project.  If the data becomes lost or is corrupted you may not be able to complete your project or verfiy it if required.  In ACHDS we frequently work with highly sensitive data and so it is essential that this data is stored appropriately and that no gateway is provided for unauthorized access.

You will also be prompted to think about storage and back-up when you work through your 'Data Management Plan'.  This will include questions such as these from the [DDC DMP Checklist](https://www.dcc.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/resource/DMP/DMP-checklist-flyer.pdf)

* Do you have sufficient storage or will you need to include charges for additional services?
* Who will be responsible for backup and recovery?
* What are the risks to data security and how will these be managed?
* How will you ensure that collaborators can access your data securely? 

The university provide a range of storage solutions and information about these can be found on their webpage [Data Storage and Archiving](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/staffnet/working-here/it-services/datastorage.php#panel2066).  

Note that in this instance 'archiving' does not refer to curation and storage of data, but simply to long term storage.  However, if you store clear [contextual information](https://abdnchds.github.io/guidebook/metadata.html) and/or a completed [Data Documentation Template](https://github.com/AbdnCHDS/DataDocumentationTemplate) with your data, then you will have done the necessary curatorial work to help your data be findable, understandable and re-useable.
